## An Extended Mind System

This repository contains the documentation for my personal extended mind system - a productivity methodology I've developed over years of experimentation and trial and error. If you're familiar with the following books, you'll see their fingerprints throughout:

- The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll
- Getting Things Done by David Allen
- The Organized Mind by Daniel Levitin

I read these works, implemented their systems, and over time adapted them into something distinctly my own.

In the age of AI, externalizing our thoughts is more important than ever - not only as a future artifact to ourselves but also as context for LLMs. Applied AI is integrated throughout the system to demonstrate how it can be used to help build and maintain an extended mind system.

**What this is:** Think of this as an opinionated Linux distro for productivity - a fully working system you can use as-is or modify to suit your needs. The methodology itself is tool-agnostic, but I'll be sharing implementations for Notion and Obsidian, complete with working examples and templates. 

**Why it exists:** After years of tinkering with my own Notion setup and refining what actually works, I decided to document the whole thing as software documentation rather than write a traditional productivity book. This lets me keep it living and updated, show real implementations alongside theory, and give people something practical they can see in action before adopting.

**What makes this ambitious:** This is a true end-to-end project. I'm building the infrastructure (GitHub, Mintlify, Cloudflare R2 for assets, Claude for coding + editing), writing all the content, creating the sample implementations, and designing the templates. Each use case stands alone but fits into the broader system, released incrementally as I finish documenting them.

## Current Status
**In active development.** The site has not been officially published yet. I'm currently in the initial building phase - standing up infrastructure, finalizing content, and preparing the first use cases for release. When the site officially launches, the changelog will be updated with the initial release notes.

This is very much a work in progress - a significant undertaking to document years of practical system design. The goal is to create something genuinely useful that people can learn from and adapt to better their own lives, completely free and open.
