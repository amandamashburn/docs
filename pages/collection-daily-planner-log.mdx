## What to expect

Most planning systems ask you to choose between planning ahead and capturing what actually happened. The Daily Planner & Log does both – one page per day, structured to hold your intentions in the morning and your reality by evening. It's the nerve center of the Extended Mind System: the place where everything else converges into a single day.

## What will be covered

**One page per day**. Each entry is a single database page named with a consistent date format (e.g., `2026.02.25 (WED)`). The naming convention matters: it makes navigation fast, keeps entries sortable, and creates a permanent, searchable record of every day.

**What lives in the properties vs. the page**. Properties hold structured data: the date, a summary of what happened that day, a workout tracker, and a formula-derived week number. The page itself holds everything else – tasks, notes, chores, reflections, and whatever the day requires.

**Planning vs. logging**. The collection is designed to capture both what you intended and what actually happened. These are not the same thing, and treating them as separate helps you understand how your days play out compared to how you aspired them to be.

**Linking to Life Log entries.** How to connect Life Log entries to the Daily Planner and Log and vice versa to reinforce the idea of writing something once and referencing it elsehwere. 

**AI Applied.** Using voice dictaction software (e.g., Wispr Flow) and AI summarization to finally build that daily reflection habit.

**Page templates**. Two templates handle the majority of days: a default daily layout for standard use, and a detailed schedule view for days that need hour-by-hour structure. Templates provide flexibility a paper planner or a hard coded app cannot.

**Views that match how you review**. A calendar view for the month-at-a-glance, a past-7-days view for the week in review, and a past-28-days view for the monthly picture. Each view is built for a specific review horizon.

**Notion implementation**. Database setup, properties, views, templates, formulas for calculating the week, automation for generating a new page with title formatted.

**Obsidian implementation**. How to replicate the collection using Bases, including property setup and view configuration.
