## About

The life log is a single, searchable database for tracking life's details – memories, milestones, decisions, journal entries, maintenance tasks, medical appointments, and anything else worth noting.

Right now, these pieces of information are most likely scattered across various apps – notes, email, files, photos (hello, screenshots). And that's even if it's recorded anywhere beyond your mind. The life log serves as a single repository so you know exactly where to log this type of information and where to find it later on for reference.

The reality is most of us can't recall what we did three days ago, let alone three years ago. The details that feel vivid in the moment quickly fade. And once they're gone, they're gone. The life log is the fix for that: a running record you build in the moment, while the details are still fresh, so future you has something to look back on.

The value of this simple system compounds over time. When you sit down for a quarterly review, want to reminisce, need to pull up details from a past event, or have to answer a question you didn't think you'd ever need to answer – you're not straining to reconstruct the past from memory or hunting down scattered bits of information and docs. It's already captured and waiting. You can see patterns across months and years: seasons of growth, a string of social activities, stretches of quiet.

**Ultimately, your life log becomes a reflection of who you are and how you spend your time.**

And eventually, it becomes something else entirely – an artifact. A record of a life, written in the voice of the person who lived it.

## A catchall by design

If your instinct is to break the life log into separate databases – one for medical appointments, one for home maintenance, one for journal entries, one for social events – resist. That instinct is understandable, but it works against you.

This is a core principle of the Extended Mind System: **start wide, not narrow**. Broad databases first. Narrower ones only if you find a genuine need for them over time. The life log is a prime example of why.

When you separate everything into its own silo, you lose context. And context is where the real insight lives.

There's cognitive science to back this up. Our brains are pattern-recognition machines, but they can only spot patterns across information they see together. This is called the [contiguity effect](https://grokipedia.com/page/Contiguity_(psychology)#contiguity-psychology) – proximity reveals relationships that distance hides. When a variety of events live in the same place, connections surface that would never appear if each type lived in its own database.

Now, categorization is encouraged within the broader scope of the database but through tags. Filter to see any one category in isolation whenever you need to. That gives you the best of both worlds: the broad view when you want context, the narrow view when you need focus. One database, full flexibility.

One thing worth clarifying: the life log is not meant to be a daily log. Think of it as a highlight reel – the significant, the pivotal, the infrequent. The thread of a life, not the minutiae of every day. If you find yourself wanting to capture day-to-day observations in more detail, that's a separate use case covered in the daily log.

## Regular reviews

The entries you do capture — the significant moments, the patterns, the details worth remembering — compound in value the longer you keep at it.

A well-maintained life log transforms your regular reviews – whether you're doing them weekly, quarterly, or annually. Rather than spending that time straining to reconstruct what happened, you can devote your energy to the thing reviews are actually for – reflection, and planning what comes next.

For a deeper look at how and why to conduct regular reviews, see (**Article pending**).

## An artifact for future generations

On my desk sits a copy of my great-grandmother's journal from the early 1900s in Western North Carolina. In it contains notes about farm life, favorite Bible verses, prices for seed, what it felt like to get dressed up to walk into town. I never got the chance to meet her, but through those pages I've gotten to know her – and more than that, I've learned from her. There is wisdom to be found woven between the ordinary details of her life.

That's what a life log can become at its best: not just a record of events, but a way to pass down hard-earned lessons, family traditions, and wisdom. A thread of connection across generations.

Just as the world my great-grandmother lived in no longer exists in it's entirety, the world we live in today will also change and feel novel to someone reading your words a hundred years from now. So don't discard a detail because it feels too small. The small ones are often the ones that matter most.

## A note to parents & caretakers

Consider starting a life log for your child or charge. In the early years you maintain it – first words, first steps, favorite things, photos of artwork. With children especially the years go by fast. Those early years can be a bit of a blur considering how much they change in such a short amount of time. As they get older, you can invite them to contribute their own entries. And when they're ready, you hand it off entirely.

What you're giving them isn't just a baby book. It's a record of their own life, started before they were old enough to keep it themselves – and a model for a habit worth carrying into adulthood.

## Building the habit – and keeping it

This is probably the hardest part of the process. Not the setup, not the structure – the habit of actually logging things consistently.

The goal is to capture entries the day they happen, or within 24 to 48 hours after. The longer you wait, the less likely you are to write it down at all – and the details that do make it onto the page will be less substantial. Memory is lossy. What feels vivid today gets fuzzy fast.

But life doesn't always give you time to sit down and write a polished entry on the spot. So consider the following approach.

**Rapid log.** As soon as you can – roughly capture the details. A few bullet points. A stream of consciousness recorded using voice to text. You're not writing the entry yet, you're preserving the raw material before it fades. Drop in a TODO for anything you want to add later: a photo, a receipt, a document, a name. The notes don't have to be pretty. They just need to exist.

**Clean it up.** When you have time to sit down at a computer, flesh it out. Note the details more clearly. Pull in the supporting material – files, photos, links. Let the rough draft and outline become a polished entry. If you captured a long wall of text, use AI to help you summarize and organize.

This is where the mobile app for your tool of choice earns its keep. Log on your phone in the moment, then refine on your desktop when you have more time.

Keep at it the life log stops feeling like another thing to do and becomes a way to pause, reflect, and be present. The contents itself become something valuable worth protecting.
