## Knowledg management as an interdiscplinary field
Knolwedge management draws from a variety of disciplines and as both a generalist and systems thinker this is one of the reason I am drawn to the field.

## KM for the individual
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## KM for the family unit
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## KM for community groups
There is an in between that I feel like gets neglected – churches, sororities, fraternities, sports teams, chess clubs, dinner clubs, local politics, homeschool groups, etc. Community groups big and small too can benefit from KM systems.

## KM for small teams
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## KM for the enterprise
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## Knowledge Management Use Cases
TODO: Research and provide 3 to 5 prominenet examples of knowledge management within an organization.

## Knowledge Managment in the age of AI
KM is undergoing a fundamental shift in the age of AI. Both as foundational for training data and context for machines. But also, AI can be used as a tool to facilitate AI capture via dictation, writing assistance, editing, summarization, probing for gaps, identifying unclear information and instructions. Then there is the oncoming glasses and robots that can observe humans in action and thus help to capture the ever elusive tacit knowledge. 

## Why I'm focused on KM for the individual (for now).
One of the biggest pain points I have seen is that we ask people to write who have never written.
We ask people to document knowledge who have never done so.
By teaching people these skills on an individual level, I better prepare them for the task of documenting, preserving, and leveraging knowledge within the enterprise.
Once my extended mind system is fully documented, I'll shift gears and begin to write about implementing knowledge management programs within an organization – large and small.
Better individuals > Better society.
KM as a tool for self-governance and lifelong learning.

TODO: I'm focused on KM but Project Management applies here as well. Need to figure out how to weave it in.
