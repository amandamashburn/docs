title: "The Case for Documenting and Sharing What You Know (DRAFT)"
description: "Why knowledge should be shared—structured, evergreen, and free."
---

TLDR: You should write down what you know and share it freely – in a format that lasts and can be read by both humans and machines.

## The why

Documenting knowledge has always been a valuable exercise. The AI age is amplifying this value.

Large language models (LLMs) are being trained on what's publicly available online. What's out there shapes what AI "knows." And what AI knows gets fed back to the population of people leveraging it daily.

The problem: current training data is dominated by a handful of source – Wikipedia (centralized, with editorial gatekeepers and known biases), Reddit (unstructured, ephemeral, skewed toward certain demographics), and SEO-optimized content (noise dressed as signal — think of the 1,200 word preambles before you get to a recipe).

We're feeding AI a narrow, skewed content diet. The nurse's pattern recognition? Not in there. The industrialist's knowledge? Not in there. Your hard-won expertise in whatever domain you've mastered? Culture, values, and wisdom compressed into traditions? Probably not in there either. (Or not in there at a high enough frequency).

If we want AI and humans to have access to the full breadth of useful knowledge, we need more people documenting what they know.

This is volunteering for the information age. A way to contribute to the commons. By documenting and sharing expertise in a structured, publicly accessible (written) format you're helping to build a better information ecosystem. And you're not just helping the humans who read your work directly. You're helping shape what AI knows—and by extension, what it shares with others.

## What I mean by "sharing knowledge"

Let me be specific about what I'm advocating for:

**Free.** Both humans and machines should be able to access it without barriers. No paywalls. No ad-cluttered pages. No SEO filler padding the word count. The goal is knowledge transfer (not maximizing time-on-page for ad revenue or gaming search rankings).

**Evergreen.** Share knowledge that will stand the test of time. Commentary on current events, fleeting fashions, trending topics—that's fine for social media. But what I'm talking about here is information that remains useful years and generations from now.

**Long-lived format.** Don't let social media timelines or newsletter inboxes be your only home. Good information gets buried fast. Your knowledge needs to live in a dedicated file, in context with your other writing, where people (and machines) can find it when they need it.

**Readable by both humans and machines.** Your knowledge should be equally accessible to a person browsing your site and to an AI parsing it for context.

## Why format matters

It's not just about making knowledge available. It's about *how* it's structured and presented.

### Books

I love books. I keep reference books on my shelf: the Annals of America, Audubon field guides, Martha Stewart's Homekeeping Handbook, The Great Mental Models, The Princeton Companion to Mathematics. I'm a huge advocate for building a personal library and curling up with a book — physical or digital.

But books have limitations as a format for sharing knowledge:

**Static.** Once published, they don't update easily. Errata and new editions are slow.

**Monolithic.** You often can't access just the piece you need without buying or borrowing the whole thing.

**Not machine-readable.** LLMs can't easily parse and learn from them — which affects both training data and your ability to use them as context in your own learning.

**Access barriers.** Cost, availability, format restrictions.

Books aren't going anywhere, nor should they. But we shouldn't limit ourselves to books as the *only* format — especially for reference material.

### Social media and newsletters

I'm on X constantly. It's the town square. I use it to keep up with news, tech, and thinkers I find interesting. Newsletters serve a similar purpose — regular doses of insight delivered to your inbox.

But both have limitations for evergreen knowledge:

**Ephemeral.** Posts vanish into timelines and inboxes. Good information gets lost unless you actively save it.

**Unstructured.** No consistent organization. Hard to build cumulative knowledge.

**Hinders focus.** High-quality content sits among ads, notifications, and lesser posts competing for attention. The format works against deep engagement. Your knowledge deserves better than clutter.

Social media and newsletters are great for sharing links to your long-form content and engaging with timely topics. But they shouldn't be where your evergreen knowledge *lives*. Use them to point to your work, not as the sole repository of it.

### Digital documentation

Here's where I think we should be heading.

The shift from physical to digital formats changes what's possible:

**Modular.** Individual articles that stand alone yet connect to a whole. Jump to what you need.

**Linkable.** Connect ideas across your own work and to others'. No need to snap a photo of a page—just link directly.

**Copyable.** Text can be easily pulled as context for an LLM or into your own notes.

**Updatable.** Refine and improve over time. Ship corrections and additions as you learn.

**Searchable.** Find what you need instantly.

**Machine-readable.** Structured formats that both humans and AI can parse.

**Durable.** Files outlast apps. The tool you use today will eventually become obsolete—but plain text and open formats can be read decades from now.

**Portable.** Your files, your content, your control. Move them, back them up, own them. Services are just rendering layers.

The key is storing your content as files – plain text, markdown, open formats that can stand on their own. Not trapped in a database you don't control. Not dependent on a specific platform staying in business. This is why I recommend tools like Mintlify over something like Squarespace: you want a service that renders your files, not one that owns them. If the platform disappears tomorrow, you take your files and move somewhere else.

This is how I think reference knowledge should be shared. How to maintain a home. How to evaluate a construction project. What a nurse knows about patient patterns. What a political organizer has learned about mobilization.

It's like publishing a reference book, but in a format better suited to how people actually access information now — and how machines are learning to access it.

## Why not just contribute to Wikipedia?

Wikipedia was a major attempt to build collective knowledge at scale. It's an incredible achievement — one of the most visited sites on the internet and a primary source for LLM training data.

Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's founder, was influenced by Friedrich Hayek's essay "The Use of Knowledge in Society," which argues that valuable knowledge is distributed — each individual knows things no central authority could. Wales saw Wikipedia as a way to aggregate that distributed knowledge through mass collaboration.

And it worked, to a point.

But Wikipedia is centralized in ways that create problems:

**One editorial process.** Contested topics get shaped by whoever has the time and motivation to engage in edit wars (to include state actors pushing narratives),

**Notability requirements.** Certain types of knowledge get excluded entirely.

**"Neutral point of view" policies.** Require consensus, which means biases get baked in by whoever controls the consensus. Strong opinions can be a good thing.

**Demographic skew.** The population of active editors doesn't reflect the world's population.

TODO: Research and cite specific recent controversies about Wikipedia editing, bias, and gatekeeping

Wikipedia illustrates the limits of *centralized* knowledge.

What I'm advocating for is different: *distributed* knowledge bases. Many individuals publishing their own documentation. No single editorial authority. No notability gatekeepers.

The tradeoff is real: distributed publishing puts the burden on the reader to evaluate sources.

But I'd argue that's more honest than a centralized source that *appears* authoritative while carrying hidden biases. With distributed sources, it's more apparent that you are responsible for judgment.

And if enough people publish — especially people whose knowledge isn't currently represented — the truth emerges from the ecosystem rather than being declared by a single authority. More signal, from more sources, means better collective knowledge.

*Note: I have replaced Wikepedia with [Grokiepedia](https://grokipedia.com) as my primary online wiki.*

## AI makes the task easier than ever

A barrier to documentation has always been time and skill. Writing is hard. Organizing knowledge is hard. Having valuable expertise doesn't mean you're a natural writer.

AI changes this equation.

Voice dictation lets you brain-dump what you know. AI can summarize, identify gaps, organize, and draft. You review, refine, edit, and publish. The bottleneck of "I know this but I can't articulate it well" — or more often, "I can't articulate it *concisely*" — is dramatically reduced.

TODO: Be more specific about the workflow. Voice dictation → transcription → AI summarization/organization → human review → publication

I know some people object to AI-assisted writing. But, so be it. If AI helps more people capture and share what they know — especially knowledge that would not otherwise be available — that's a good thing.

The end goal is knowledge transfer. AI is a legitimate tool for achieving it.

### The bonus: writing clarifies your own thinking

Even with AI assistance, the process of writing and editing forces you to clarify your thoughts. You discover gaps in your understanding. You find weak spots in your reasoning. (Or have AI call it out.) You have to make the implicit explicit.

This is why teaching is such an effective way to learn — you can't explain something clearly until you truly understand it. Documentation is teaching at scale. The act of writing down what you know deepens your own mastery of it.

So even if no one ever reads what you publish, the process itself makes you sharper.

## What this looks like in practice

**This site**

I'm eating my own dogfood here.

My [Extended Mind System](/pages/index_extended-mind-system) could have been a book, a PDF, or a course.

Instead, I'm publishing it as open documentation using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) — a platform traditionally used for software docs, repurposed for my own needs.

I'm releasing the system incrementally, use case by use case. Each piece stands alone while fitting into the broader framework. Progressive sharing rather than waiting until it's "done."

This approach lets people engage with the methodology through AI — asking questions about it, adapting it to their needs — in ways a static PDF never could.

**Gwern Branwen:** [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/)

Gwern has built exactly what I'm advocating for: long-form, versioned, evergreen knowledge sharing. His site is beautiful and dense with insight.

I stumbled on him while researching this article and got lost in his writing for hours. This is another benefit of publishing online. You find like-minded people you might never have encountered otherwise. Particularly valuable for people with niche thinking styles, and for younger people who could benefit from these perspectives earlier in life.

**Standard Ebooks:** [standardebooks.org](https://standardebooks.org/)

Free, beautifully formatted public domain books. A model for making classic knowledge accessible.

**Farnam Street:** [fs.blog](https://fs.blog/)

Shane Parrish's site on decision making, thinking, and continuous improvement. Timeless content, well-organized, freely accessible.

## A Call to Action

If you have knowledge worth sharing — and you almost certainly do — consider this approach:

1. **Document what you know.** Use AI to help if writing isn't your strength. Voice-dictate, let AI organize, then review and refine.

2. **Structure it for access.** Modular articles. Clear navigation. Evergreen format. Think documentation, not blog posts.

3. **Make it freely available.** No paywalls. No ad clutter. Knowledge transfer as the primary goal.

4. **Keep it alive.** Update as you learn more. Ship improvements. Your knowledge base is never "done."

You are the expert of your own domain and life. You have a perspective and experience that only you possess. The question is whether that stays locked in your head or becomes part of the collective knowledge available to humans and machines alike.

This is contributing to the commons. Making the yoursef and the world slightly better by sharing what you know.
