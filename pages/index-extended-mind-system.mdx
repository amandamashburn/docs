description: "A personal methodology for organizing information, managing projects, and building a system that helps you think."

This is my personal approach to how I think, remember, maintain, prioritize, and do – a system I've built and adapted over years of daily use.

## This might be for you if...

- You've lost information you wish you had kept – a detail, a decision, a conversation, a document – and had no good place to look for it
- You've tried to remember what you were doing this time last year and come up mostly empty
- You have notes, files, and ideas scattered across apps and haven't found a system that pulls it all together
- You've been curious about Notion or Obsidian but don't know where to start or how to organize it in a way that actually makes sense
- You want a system that grows with you – one that handles your work, your personal life, and everything in between without requiring a different tool for each

If you're a fan of any of the following books or topics, you'll likely be a fan of this system too – and you'll definitely see their influence:

[The Bullet Journal Method](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0008261407) by Ryder Carroll – An analog system for tracking the past, organizing the present, and planning for the future.

[Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143126563) by David Allen – The classic methodology for capturing, organizing, and executing on everything that has your attention.

[The Organized Mind](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0241965780) by Daniel Levitin – How the brain handles information overload, and why externalizing your thinking matters.

[Commonplace Book](https://grokipedia.com/page/Commonplace_book) – The centuries-old practice of collecting quotes, ideas, and observations in a single place. A historical ancestor of personal knowledge management.

[Extended Mind Thesis](https://grokipedia.com/page/Extended_mind_thesis) – The philosophical argument that cognition isn't limited to our brains – tools and environments are part of how we think.

[Personal Knowledge Management](https://grokipedia.com/page/Personal_knowledge_management) – The broader field of practices and tools for capturing, organizing, and retrieving what you know.

[Zettelkasten](https://grokipedia.com/page/Zettelkasten) – Niklas Luhmann's slip-box method for building a network of atomic, interlinked notes. A direct influence on modern tools like Obsidian.

## How to use this system and site

The methodology is tool-agnostic, but each use case includes practical implementations for Notion and Obsidian. It's meant as a starting point – take what works, leave what doesn't, and adapt it to your own thinking style.

This is non-linear system so there is no one right way to move through the material. Some of you will want to read every sentence on every page and build a full picture before implementing anything. Others will want to get straight to it – pick the collection that interests you most and start there. Each one is written to stand alone and be implemented on its own. If you're undecided, start with the [Life Log](/pages/collection-life-log).

Both work. The docs are set up to support either approach.

**The one prerequisite:** If you are not already familiar with the concept of databases – specifically how they work in Notion and Obsidian – read [Databases and metadata in your Extended Mind System](#) before diving into any use case. It is the one foundational concept that underpins everything else. Every use case assumes you have it. It won't take long, and it will make everything that follows significantly clearer.

## Current status

Use cases are added as they are documented.
