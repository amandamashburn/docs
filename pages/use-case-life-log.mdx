## Prerequisite: If you are unfamiliar with the concept of databases please begin here [point to article on Notion databases and Obsidian bases].

## About

The problem: You can't remember what happened three days ago, let alone three years ago.

The solution: The life log is a space to track life's details and note anything you may want or need to remember later on.

I rarely say something is for everyone, but I legitimately cannot think of a single person who would not benefit from keeping a life log. So if you're just getting started with building an extended mind system. Start with this one.

## A catchcall that provides context

Some of what gets tracked in the life log, you may be already capturing today. Pieces may sit in your notes, long form journals, calendars, text messages, photos, etc. Elements are there but they are dispersed. Should you need to locate the information, you have to look in more than one place to find it. That's if it has been noted at all.

But with a life log, that information sits in a single container at the ready for reference.

Now, one of the things you'll here me say when it comes to databases in your extended mind system is to begin wide, not narrow. This is especially true for the life log. It has a very broad scope (all of life's details) and that is by design. 

You could easily chunk your life into categories: family, health, career, education, social events, vacations, etc. And you will just with tags not databases. The reason why we keep everything together is because you want to see it within context of one another. You can see when you have seasons that lean towards one type of an event over another. By seeing all these details together, you spot patterns. Perhaps you have a heavy social season or study season or a bout when you were perpetually sick. You'll see patterns that could be missed had it not all been written down and listed together.

Also, another reason for keeping such a broad bucket is that, inevitably, you are going to come up with a detail or piece of information that does not fit within an existing database / category. By keeping the category broad (i.e., life) a lot of event falls under that category so you reduce the cognitive load of figuring out where to file the piece of inforamtion. Especially for those one off and infrequent events like a 50th anniversary or replacing the roof on the house or a cross country move.

## Types of entries

Here are the types of items to includein the life log. Keep in mind, this is not an inclusive list. Merely a subset of what is possible.
Another thing to note, the life log is not meant to be a daily log (I'll cover that in a seperate use case). Think of it like a higlight reel with a through day to day observations thrown in. So why there is a time and place to record the day to day (again, covered in the daily log) try to keep this as a more major timeline. Those pivotal and infrequent moments.

**Social events.** Holidays, parties, brunch with friends, networking events. Note where and when it was. Who was there. How was the time spent.

**Long form journal entries.** If you are an ad hoc long form journaler, include the entries in the life log. Perhaps you have a day when you just need to think through something or you have a particular moment in time you want capture. Include it here. If you prefer to journal by hand you can always scan the pages and add them to your Notion page as a PDF.

**Medical events.** Even something as simple as the flu or a cold, surgery, appointments, lab work, medications, etc. Any and all items related to medical history ought to get noted so you have a running record. This can be very helpful if you get quite sick or have a weird string of symptoms or are managing a chronic condition.

**Historical events.** This is one of my favorites. News is constant yet fleeting. But there are some moments that you know history is being made – a space launch, the US hockey team winning gold at the Olympics for the first time since the Miracle on Ice in 1980, a presidential innaguration, a high profile criminal case, etc. By noting these items you not only see what is happening in your life, but always what was happening in the world more broadly.

**Decisions.** There are times in our life when we come to a crossroads – what college should we choose, the decision to get married, the choice to start a business, the decision to end a friendship that has run its course. The decision to committing to get in shape. These are the things that weigh on our minds and that we devote time and energy to to deciding and doing. Because these decisions impact our life's trajectory. It's worth noting how the decision came to be and deciding what and why you did what you did. How did you arrive at the decision. Where do you hope the decision will lead. Meanwhile, the process of writing this all out can actually become an excersice in helping you decide. In time, you'll build a record of the decisions you made and why.

**Successes & failures.** Life is full of ups and downs. And it's equally important to capture both. The successes to celebrate. The failures to learn what went wrong so that mistakes can be avoided in the future. 

**Major purchases.** You may want to set a threshold for this. For example, any purchase over $500 gets notes and logged. Take note of what you bought, why you bought it, warranty information, receipt, and upload a copy of the manual (download it or scan it to a PDF with your phone). This can be an especially interesting exercise to see how prices change over the years due to inflation. And it can keep you honest in how you actually spend major dollars. It can also help you decide down the road if it's really time for an upgrade or not.

**Maintenance.** Home, auto, appliances, etc. Note the date, who did the work, their contact info, what was done, upload a copy of the receipt and warranty. Then if you ever need to revisit it, you have detailed notes and do not have to rely on memory. When it comes to house and cars, this could be valuable information to pass along to someone who buys or inherits the house / car.

**Milestones.** Births, deaths, graduations, weddings, major anniversaries, promotions, retirements, etc. Note the details. Who was there. How did you feel. What happened. What did you eat. Scan the invitation / announcement and include it as a PDF. Upload a select photo or two.

**Financial goals.** Did you get out of debt? Did you get a raise? Did you reach a savings target? These are good things to note as well to track your finanical journey.

**Move dates.** Note when you moved in and when you moved along with the full address. Address history is one of those things that is not frequently accessed, but if you move a lot and ever have to do a background check or credit check, it can be a huge timesaver. 

**Reading log.** Did you finish a book? Complete a course? Listen to an epic podcast? Note it down. It's a way to see what your content diet has been.

Tip: If information does live in other database, you can link the pages. For example, you may want to note when you finsished a book by linking to the entry in your books database or when you finished a major project by linking to your projects database or note the day you met someone by linking to their entry in your people's database.

## Building the habit
Honestly, this is probably the most difficult part of the whole use case. Getting into the habit of knowing what to record and actually recording it.

Now this does mean you need to get into the habit of logging things as they happen. Ideally, log things the day they happen or shortly after. You can also set up a regular reminder to batch update the logs.

If you keep your life log updated with all the details, in time, it becomes a reflection of how you spend your days. This can be valuable view to see if you are living the life you want to live.

**Your life log becomes a reflection of how you spend your time.*

## The quarterly review
For those of you that like to do quarterly or annual reviews (which I highly encourage because they are a wonderful to reflect on what has passed and plan for what's ahead), the life log becomes very valuable especially if you have been in the habit of updating it regularly. Because when you update in the moment or soon after, the details are richer because they are fresh. And so you capture lots of data points that would be lost to time. So when you sit down to your review, you do not have to waste minutes on remembering (which would inevitably have less entries and details at that point) and you can devote all your time to reflection. And then using than information as a baseline to see how you would like your next quarter to be.

## An artifact for future generations
Additionally, I would encourage you to record even the things you consider mundane. You see, on my desk sits a copy of my granmother's journal that reflected farm life in the early 1900s in Western North Carolina. Prices, favorite bible verses, family poems, stories, weather, descriptions of daily life like getting dressed up to walk into town. It was a different world then. Just as the world we experience today will be a different world 100 years from now. I am so grateful to have her journal because I never got a chance to meet her, but through her journals I have still gotten to know her and have even learned from some of the wisdom she shared in those pages. So, your life log becomes not only an artifact for yourself to reflect upon and remember your own life, it can become a cherished treasure for future generations. A way for them to know you and learn from you, even if you never get the chance to meet. So, again, don't think a detail is too mundane or too small, because, even the daily details of life could prove novel to future generations.

## A note to parents
In lieu of a traditional babybook, you could start a life log for your child. And when they are old enough to maintain it for themselves, you can hand it off. You could even have your child write or type some of their entries. Take snapshots of their artwork. Note sports and school and teachers and all those details that tend to get lost. 

So to recap, the lifelog becomes a way for you to remember, to reflect, and an artifact not only for yourself but for future generations.
