## What it is

The lifelog is a container to track life's details and nothing you may want or need to remember later on.

## Why you need it

You can't remember what you did three days ago let alone three years ago. The life log
- Helps you to remember 
- Reduces cognitive load by creating a broad bucket to track life's details. [Life Event Types](pages/reference-life-events.mdx)

**The problem:** You can't remember what happened three days ago, let alone three years ago.

**The solution:** The life log is a space to track life's details and note anything you may want or need to remember later on.

## A catchall by design

Some of what gets tracked in the life log you may already be capturing today. Pieces may sit in your notes, long form journals, calendars, text messages, photos, etc. The elements are there but they are dispersed. Should you need to locate the information, you have to look in more than one place to find it. That's if it has been noted at all.

With a life log, that information sits in a single, searchable container at the ready for reference.

Now, one of the things you'll hear me say when it comes to databases in your extended mind system is to begin wide, not narrow. This is especially true for the life log. It has a very broad scope – all of life's details – and that is by design.

You could easily chunk your life into categories: family, health, career, education, social events, vacations, etc. And you will, just with tags not databases. The reason we keep everything together is because you want to see it all within context of one another. You can see when you have seasons that lean towards one type of event over another. By seeing all these details together, you spot patterns. Perhaps you have a heavy social season or study season or a bout when you were perpetually sick. Those patterns could be missed had it not all been written down and listed together.

The other reason for keeping such a broad bucket is that, inevitably, you are going to come across a detail or piece of information that does not fit within an existing category. By keeping the scope broad (i.e., life), a lot of events fall under that umbrella so you reduce the cognitive load of figuring out where to file something. Especially for those one-off and infrequent events like a 50th anniversary or replacing the roof on the house or a cross-country move.

## The quarterly review

For those of you that like to do quarterly or annual reviews (which I highly encourage because they are wonderful for reflecting on what has passed and planning for what's ahead), the life log becomes especially valuable if you have been updating it regularly. When you update in the moment or soon after, the details are richer because they are fresh. You capture data points that would otherwise be lost to time. So when you sit down for your review, you do not have to waste time trying to remember (which would inevitably produce fewer entries and thinner details). You can devote all your energy to reflection – and then use that information as a baseline to shape how you'd like your next quarter to look.

## An artifact for future generations

I would encourage you to record even the things you consider mundane. You see, on my desk sits a copy of my grandmother's journal that reflected farm life in the early 1900s in Western North Carolina. Prices, favorite bible verses, family poems, stories, weather, descriptions of daily life like getting dressed up to walk into town. It was a different world then. Just as the world we experience today will be a different world 100 years from now. I am so grateful to have her journal because I never got the chance to meet her, but through her journals I have still gotten to know her and have even learned from some of the wisdom she shared in those pages.

Your life log becomes not only an artifact for yourself to reflect upon and remember your own life – it can become a cherished treasure for future generations. A way for them to know you and learn from you, even if you never get the chance to meet. So don't think a detail is too mundane or too small, because even the daily details of life could prove novel to future generations.

## A note to parents & caretakers

In lieu of a traditional baby book, you could start a life log for your child. When they are old enough to maintain it themselves, you can hand it off. You could even have your child write or type some of their entries. Take snapshots of their artwork. Note sports and school and teachers and all those details that tend to get lost.

## Building the habit

This is probably the most difficult part of the whole use case – getting into the habit of knowing what to record and actually recording it. Ideally, log things the day they happen or shortly after while the details are still fresh. You can also set up a regular reminder to batch update the logs.

If you keep your life log updated with all the details, in time, it becomes a reflection of how you spend your days. A valuable view to see if you are living the life you want to live.

**Your life log becomes a reflection of how you spend your time.**

## Recommended views

TODO: Include screenshots for each of the views below OR point to the template.

**Calendar (for Notion).** See all event laid as a calendar. Helps visualize the timeline for events.

**04 week view.** Filter on dates that have occured in the past four weeks. This is a reasonable time frame to see trends and patterns to ensure you're spending your time how you want without becoming overwhelmed by looking at everything.

**Category specific.** If you have a particular category you'd like to see in isolation (e.g., reading log, medical history) you can filter based on the tag(s) for that category.
