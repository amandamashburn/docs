Hello, I'm Amanda. Welcome to my public knowledge base.

This is where I document and share knowledge I've built up over years of working in tech, building systems, tinkering, and, generally, just living life.

## What you'll find

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Articles" href="/pages/article-infrastructure">
    An eclectic collection of evergreen writing. These are standalone pieces, not tied to the Extended Mind System.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extended Mind System" href="/pages/index-extended-mind-system">
    My methodology for organizing information. Tool-agnostic in philosophy, with implementations for Notion and Obsidian. Use cases are released incrementally as I document them.
  </Card>

## A few things to know

**This site is actively being built.** I'm building (and thinking) in public, which means you're seeing the work in progress. Content will be added, reorganized, and refined over time.

**You'll see drafts.** When an article title contains **(DRAFT)**, it means I'm still writing, researching, or editing it. If you'd rather read the finished version, just wait for the DRAFT label to disappear.

**Bookmark the top-level URL.** Save [docs.amandamashburn.com](https://docs.amandamashburn.com) rather than bookmarking individual pages. I'm prone to renaming and reorganizing files, which breaks page-level URLs. The top-level domain will always get you to the right place. Once the site structure stabilizes, individual page links will be safe to save.
