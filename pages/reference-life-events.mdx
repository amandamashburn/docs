# Life event types

This page is a reference guide for the kinds of entries that belong in your life log. It is not an exhaustive list – think of it as a starting point and a prompt. Over time you will develop a feel for what warrants an entry. When in doubt, log it.

A few things to keep in mind as you read through these:

**Link, don't duplicate.** If information lives in another database – books, projects, people, places – link to the relevant page rather than restating everything. The life log entry can be a moment in time that points elsewhere.

**Write for future you and future generations.** Include details you think you'll remember. You won't.

**Write for AI.** Detailed, well-written entries become rich context for AI-assisted reviews, pattern recognition, and summaries down the road.

## Milestones & celebrations

The moments that mark time – both the ones you plan for and the ones that arrive without warning.

**What belongs here:** Birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, weddings, retirements, births, deaths, milestone achievements, championships, reunions, holidays. etc.

**What to note:**
- Who was there
- Where it took place
- Details of the occasion – food, atmosphere, traditions, music
- How it felt emotionally
- A few favorite photos; scan invitations, announcements, programs if you have them

Some of these happen every year. Some happen once. Both deserve an entry.

## Journal entries

Long-form reflection has well-documented benefits – it helps you think, process, and decide. The life log is a natural home for ad hoc journal entries: working through a decision, capturing a moment of clarity, remembering a perfect day.

**What to note:**
- Write freely without concern for grammar or mechanics – this is for you
- For especially long entries, use AI to generate a short summary at the top for easier reference later on
- If you prefer to write by hand, scan or transcribe the entry so it's searchable

**A note on daily journaling:** If you journal every single day, consider keeping a dedicated database for it rather than mixing it into the life log. The life log works best as a highlight reel, not a daily diary. Reserve it for the entries that rise above the day-to-day.

## Decisions

The crossroads moments – choosing a college, leaving a job, beginning a relationship, committing to a major project. These deserve their own entry because the decision itself is an event, and the reasoning behind it is worth preserving.

**What to note:**
- What the decision was and what you were weighing
- How you arrived at it – what tipped the scales
- What you hoped it would lead to
- How it actually turned out (add this later as a follow-up note)

Writing the decision out often helps you make it. And looking back at past decisions – the logic, the fears, the hopes – reveals a lot about who you were and how you've changed.



## Health & medical

A running medical history in one place is more useful than it sounds – especially when symptoms seem unrelated until you see them together over time.

**What to note:**
- Doctor's appointments: who you saw, what was discussed, next steps
- Diagnoses and treatments
- Medications: what, dosage, duration
- Illnesses – including ordinary ones like colds and flu
- Lab results and imaging (attach or link)
- Surgeries and procedures

Patterns become visible here that would be invisible otherwise. A string of social events depleting your immune system. Seasonal allergies triggered by a new location. Stress showing up in the body before you recognized it as stress. If you are managing a chronic condition, thorough logging here is especially valuable.

## Work & career

Your professional arc, captured in real time rather than reconstructed for a resume years later.

**What to note:**
- Job changes: start dates, end dates, role, company
- Promotions, raises, performance reviews
- Major projects completed – what went well, what you'd do differently
- Professional decisions and pivots
- Certifications, courses, and skills acquired

This section pays dividends when you're updating a resume, preparing for a review, or reflecting on where you've been professionally.

## Education & learning

Books finished, courses completed, podcasts that shifted your thinking, skills you built. A record of how your mind has grown.

**What to note:**
- Title, author or source, date completed
- Key takeaways or ideas worth remembering
- Link to the full entry in your knowledge bank or reading log if one exists

Over time you see your content diet – a record of what you've been consuming and how it has shaped your thinking.

## Major purchases

Set a threshold that makes sense for you – for example, anything over $500.

**What to note:**
- What you bought, why, and how much you paid
- Warranty information and receipt (scan or attach)
- Manual or product documentation (download the PDF if available)
- Whether it was worth it – add a note a year later

Over time this becomes an honest record of how you spend significant money, a useful reference when warranties expire or something needs repair, and an interesting window into how prices change over years.

One situation where this record becomes unexpectedly critical: theft, fire, or natural disaster. When you need to file an insurance claim, you are suddenly asked to recall every significant item you own – what it was, what you paid, when you bought it – from memory, under stress, at the worst possible time. A well-maintained purchases log turns that process from a nightmare into a straightforward document you can hand over.

## Home & auto maintenance

Every repair, every service appointment, every contractor who came through.

**What to note:**
- Date of service
- What was done
- Who did the work and their contact information
- Cost
- Receipt and warranty (attach)

This record is valuable in the moment – no more trying to remember when the HVAC was last serviced – and potentially valuable to someone who buys or inherits the property later. For cars especially, a documented maintenance history has real monetary worth.

## Financial milestones

Not day-to-day budgeting, but the meaningful markers on your financial journey.

**What to note:**
- Paying off a debt
- Reaching a savings or investment target
- Getting a raise or changing your income significantly
- Major financial decisions

These entries give you a timeline of financial progress that's otherwise easy to lose track of. While acting as a reminder to be cognizant of lifestyle creep as income increases.

## Travel

Trips worth remembering, from weekend getaways to major international travel.

**What to note:**
- Where you went and when
- Who you were with
- Highlights – places, food, moments, people you met
- What surprised you
- A few favorite photos

Travel memories compress and blur faster than you'd expect. An entry written the day you return captures details that feel obvious in the moment and completely inaccessible two years later.

## Social events

The texture of your social life – the dinners, the nights out, the gatherings that don't fit neatly into milestones but were worth showing up for.

**What to note:**
- Who was there
- What the occasion was
- Any detail worth remembering – a conversation, a moment, something that made it memorable

This category is where patterns about yourself tend to surface. How often you're socializing, whether you feel energized or depleted afterward, whether your social life reflects the relationships you actually want to invest in.

For the introverts, it keeps you honest about how often you're actually socializing.

## Moves & addresses

Every address you've lived at, with dates in and out.

**What to note:**
- Full address
- Move-in and move-out dates
- Any notes about the place or the circumstances of the move

Address history is one of those things that feels unnecessary until you suddenly need it – a background check, a credit application, a legal matter. Having it already logged saves a surprising amount of time.

## World & historical events

The moments when you know history is being made.

**What to note:**
- What happened
- Where you were and how you experienced it
- What it felt like in real time – before you knew how it turned out

A space launch. An election. A major court ruling. A cultural moment. Logging these places your personal timeline inside a larger historical one. Future readers – including future you – will appreciate seeing what the world looked like from where you were standing.

## Natural world & sky

Eclipses, meteor showers, significant weather, unusual natural events.

**What to note:**
- What the event was and when
- Where you observed it from
- What it was like to witness it

This category is one that tends to get underutilized but is meaningful for tracking natural cycles and to reflect that the world that extends beyond the personal. These entries tend to age particularly well.

## Growth milestones – for children

For parents and caretakers logging on behalf of a child.

**What to note:**
- Developmental firsts: words, steps, reading, riding a bike
- School milestones: teachers, grades, activities, friends
- Personality and interests as they emerge
- Photos and artwork

The early years move fast and blur together. What feels unforgettable now won't be. Log it anyway.

## Major project retrospectives

After a significant project wraps – building a home, launching a business, completing a renovation, planting a seasonal garden – take stock while it's fresh.

**What to note:**
- What the project was and when it happened
- What went well
- What you'd do differently
- What surprised you
- Key contacts, vendors, or resources worth saving

The practical details can inform your next project or prove to be useful notes for others taking on a similar task.

## Pets

For many people, pets are as much a part of the family as anyone else. Their lives deserve a thread in your log.

**What to note:**
- Adoption or birth date, breed, name
- Vet visits, health issues, medications
- Funny or memorable moments
- Death and the circumstances around it

The lifespan of a pet fits entirely within a human life, which makes the log especially poignant. People are often surprised how much they want this record after an animal is gone.

## Faith & spiritual life

Not universal, but significant for those it applies to.

**What to note:**
- Religious milestones: baptisms and first communions
- Moments of spiritual clarity or struggle
- Practices, texts, or communities that shaped your thinking

This is one of the more personal categories in the log. Write it for yourself.

## Creative work & hobbies

The things you do outside of work that define you just as much – sometimes more.

**What to note:**
- Creative projects completed: paintings, quilts, writing, music, woodworking
- Skills learned and milestones reached: first 5K, first solo trip, first harvest from a garden
- Competitions, exhibitions, or performances
- What you were working on during a given season of life

These entries tend to get skipped because they don't feel important enough. They are. The hobbies and creative pursuits that fill your off hours say a great deal about who you are.

## Relationships & people

The relational arc of a life – who came into it, who stayed, who changed you.

**What to note:**
- When and how you met someone significant
- Moments that deepened or changed a relationship
- Friendships that ended and the circumstances
- People who came back into your life

Keep detailed notes in your [People database](#) and link entries here rather than duplicating. The life log entry captures the moment in time – when you met, when something shifted – while the People database holds the fuller picture of who that person is to you.
