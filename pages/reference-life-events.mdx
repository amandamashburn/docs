## Types of entries

Here are some of the types of items to include in the life log. This is not an exhaustive list – merely a sampler of what is possible.

One thing to note: the life log is not meant to be a daily log (I'll cover that in a separate use case). Think of it like a highlight reel with the through-line of day-to-day observations. So while there is a time and place to record the day to day (again, covered in the daily log), try to keep this as the more significant timeline. Those pivotal and infrequent moments.

Remember when writing the entries, the audience is future you, future generations and AI.

Tip: If information does live in another database, you can link the pages. For example, you may want to note when you finished a book by linking to the entry in your books database, or when you finished a major project by linking to your projects database, or note the day you met someone by linking to their entry in your people database.

TODO: Include an image as an example of linking a page as a lifelog entry.

## Celebrations – milestones, birthdays, holidays, social events.

Life is full of moments to celebrate. Some come around every year like holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries. Some events like championships and milestone birthdays / anniversaries happen a handful of times in your life. Some come around only once such as births, deaths, graduations, weddings, and retirements. Then you the have the occasions that happen with a bit more frequency – brunch with friends, a date night, an impactful night out.

You snap photos and think you'll remember, but enough of them pass, and over time the details get a little fuzzy and may even blend together from one event to the next. So take note:

- Who was there?
- Where was the moment spent?
- What were the details? Ambiance, food, drinks, music, traditions.
- How did the occasion feel on an emotional level?

Include a few favorite photos. If there was an invitation or announcement, scan it, and add it to the page as well.

## Long form journal entries.

There are a myriad of benefits to long form journaling. My personal favorite? It helps you think. Esepcially if you're working through a problem /decision and are searching for a solution.

If you prefer to handwrite your long form journal entries (for the mind to hand connection) you can still include the pages in your life log either by using a text to type software (reMarkable has this built in) or by scanning the page (Apple has a built in scanner). Including the journal entry as text is the more ideal approach especially for search or to use with AI. You can also skip the handwriting all together and type the journal entry directly (this is what I most often do as I type faster than I write) or you can also use voice to text (which subsequently is even faster than typing).

For especially long form journal entries, I like to use AI to write a short summary in bullet form at the top of the page. This helps with reviews down the road to refresh your memory without having to read a wall of text.

I recommend using the life log to store ad hoc long form journal entries. If you are in the habit of daily long form journaling, you may want to consider keeping a dedicated database to maintain the goal of the life log being a highlight reel. Something to consider, but ultimately it's your call. You can always break the pages out or merge them in if you change your mind.

## Reviews – weekly, quarterly, annual.

TODO: Create an ARTICLE + TEMPLATE on why and how to conduct regular reviews.

Break down common cadences: Daily, weekly, every 04 weeks, each season (to align with the solistices and equinoxes), and annual.

**Long form journal entries.** 

If you are an ad hoc long form journaler, include the entries in the life log. Perhaps you have a day when you just need to think through something or you have a particular moment in time you want to capture. Include it here. If you prefer to journal by hand, you can always scan the pages and add them to your Notion page as a PDF.

**Medical events.**

Even something as simple as the flu or a cold, along with surgery, appointments, lab work, medications, etc. Any and all items related to medical history ought to get noted so you have a running record. This can be very helpful if you get quite sick, have a weird string of symptoms, or are managing a chronic condition.

**Historical events.**

This is one of my favorites. News is constant yet fleeting. But there are some moments when you know history is being made – a space launch, the US hockey team winning gold at the Olympics for the first time since the Miracle on Ice in 1980, a presidential inauguration, a high-profile criminal case. By noting these items you not only see what is happening in your life, but also what was happening in the world more broadly.

**Decisions.**

There are times in our lives when we come to a crossroads – what college to choose, the decision to get married, the choice to start a business, the decision to end a friendship that has run its course, the commitment to get in shape. These are the things that weigh on our minds and that we devote time and energy to deciding and doing. It's worth noting how the decision came to be, what you decided, and why. How did you arrive at it. Where do you hope it will lead. Meanwhile, the process of writing this all out can actually become an exercise in helping you decide. In time, you'll build a record of the decisions you made and why.

**Successes and failures.**

Life is full of ups and downs. And it's equally important to capture both. The successes to celebrate. The failures to learn what went wrong so that mistakes can be avoided in the future.

**Major purchases.**

You may want to set a threshold for this – for example, any purchase over $500 gets noted and logged. Take note of what you bought, why you bought it, warranty information, receipt, and upload a copy of the manual (download it or scan it to a PDF with your phone). Over time this becomes an interesting record of how prices change due to inflation, keeps you honest in how you spend major dollars, and can help you decide down the road whether it's really time for an upgrade.

**Home & auto maintenance.**

Home, auto, appliances, etc. Note the date, who did the work, their contact info, what was done, and upload a copy of the receipt and warranty. Then if you ever need to revisit it, you have detailed notes and do not have to rely on memory. When it comes to houses and cars, this could be valuable information to pass along to someone who buys or inherits them.

**Financial goals.**

Did you get out of debt? Did you get a raise? Did you reach a savings target? These are good things to note to track your financial journey.

**Move dates.**

Note when you moved in and when you moved out along with the full address. Address history is one of those things that is not frequently accessed, but if you move a lot and ever have to do a background check or credit check, it can be a huge timesaver.

**Reading log.**

Did you finish a book? Complete a course? Listen to an epic podcast? Note it down. It's a way to see what your content diet has been.

**Major project retrospectives.**

Think building a home, launching a business, planting a seasonal garden. Once the project is done, write up notes about how it went, what went well, what you would change, aspects that surprised you.
