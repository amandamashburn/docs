title: "The case for documeting and sharing what you know (DRAFT)"
description: "Why knowledge should be shared—structured, evergreen, and free."
---

**TLDR:** Document what you know and share it freely – in a format that lasts and can be read by both humans and machines.

Theory: Here's why sharing knowledge matters (for you, for others, for AI, for civilization).

Practice: Here's exactly how to do it (format, tools, structure, workflow).

This is about preserving and transmitting knowledge, shaping what AI becomes, fulfilling a civic responsibility as an inheritor of the Enlightenment.

The internet was supposed to be for this, we got distracted, here's how we get back to it, and here's why it matters now more than ever.

A claim to return to the internet's original promise and fulfilling a civic duty to conserve knowledge.

## The deeper why (the moral component)
I am going to let it marinate, but here are some points that are beginning to really surface and clarify for me. Capturing knowledge has always been a valuable exercise, both for the individual and society. On the individual level, it makes you a better person when you sit down and write. And you make the implicit explicit. And then others have always valued from that information because it allows them to learn faster. They don't have to reinvent the wheel. They can learn from others. They can see different perspectives and compare and contrast. So writing has always, always been valuable. That is why there was such an explosion after the Gutenberg Press became available and we were able to actually print and share books. It's becoming more critical though now because AI is coming about its training based on what's off the internet. It's not getting trained on the library of Alexandria. It's not getting trained on the library of Congress right now because there's so much of that information that still hasn't been digitized. So my hope is that, that information is being converted so it can be put into the AI's training data. I mean we would be ridiculous not to do that and I hope there's some company out there doing that. But books were their own form of gatekeeping for a long time, you know? Not everyone was writing books or self-publishing or going and filing for an ISBN for the Library of Congress. So even with the prevalence of books, not everyone was still sharing their knowledge. More people were than they would have otherwise without the press and books, but not everyone was doing it. So we were still dealing with the problem of gatekeeping subsets of information and knowledge. Then the internet came along which, as you said, democratized the ability to share knowledge but instead of all of us going online and publishing what we know and creating personal knowledge bases and sharing like really great information, the man-on-the-spot information that decentralized knowledge. Not everyone did that. They started making then social media came along. Social media was finally a way for people to quickly share their knowledge and some people did. They showed great photographs and they shared cool knowledge and insights to their life and knowledge sharing started that way but we get into the all the issues which we have already identified with why social media is not a good permanent repository for your information but then people started also shifting to create content not for knowledge sharing, but purely for attention. And that's where we arrive at the attention economy, the ad economy which has skewed the incentives of what gets shared online, how it gets shared, why it gets shared.

And so this just all comes to a broader point of... We have the internet like no one is stopping you from creating a personal knowledge base writing down what you know and sharing it and it doesn't need to be perfection. It doesn't need to be Shakespeare. It just needs to be write down your knowledge. Share it build it up over time, make sure those opinions, those values, those experiences are making their way onto the internet because right now. This is a primary source for training our AI which is an amplifier. AI is an amplifier and an accelerator. So if you are writing down what you know. And you aren't putting it online that information is getting lost and you are losing out on your vote of shaping the future. So it really does become an act of civic duty, especially in the taken as a byproduct of the Enlightenment, taken as a byproduct of scientific knowledge, taken as a byproduct of Western civilization. Like it is our responsibility as citizens to conserve this information and pass it along. 

Writing has always been valuable — for the individual (makes thinking explicit, deepens understanding) and for society (others learn faster, don't reinvent the wheel)

- Gutenberg democratized it, but gatekeeping remained — not everyone was writing books, filing ISBNs, going through publishers

- The internet promised to remove the gates — anyone can publish, no permission needed

- But we got distracted — social media made sharing easy but optimized for attention, not knowledge; the ad economy skewed incentives toward engagement over substance

- Now AI raises the stakes — training data comes from what's online; if your knowledge isn't there, it doesn't shape the future; the Library of Congress isn't in the training set, but Reddit is

- This is a civic duty — your knowledge is your vote on what AI becomes; not sharing it is forfeiting that vote; as inheritors of the Enlightenment, we have a responsibility to conserve and transmit what we know

## The why

Documenting knowledge has always had its benefits, but the AI age is amplifying the value of the exercise.

Large language models (LLMs) are being trained on what's publicly available online. What's out there shapes what AI "knows". And what AI knows gets fed back to the population of people leveraging it daily.

**The problem:** current training data is dominated by a handful of sources – Wikipedia (centralized, with editorial gatekeepers and known biases), Reddit (unstructured, ephemeral, skewed toward certain demographics), and SEO-optimized content (noise dressed as signal — think of the 1,200 word preambles before you get to a recipe).

We're feeding AI a narrow, skewed content diet – the equivalent of feeding a toddler junk food.

The nurse's pattern recognition? Not in there. The industrialist's knowledge? Not in there. Your hard-won expertise in whatever domain you've mastered? Culture, values, and wisdom compressed into traditions? Probably not in there either. (Or not in there at a high enough frequency).

If we want AI and humans to have access to the full breadth of useful knowledge, we need more people documenting what they know.

This is volunteering for the information age. A way to contribute to the commons. By documenting and sharing expertise in a structured, publicly accessible (preferably written) format you're helping to build a better information ecosystem. And you're not just helping those who read your work directly. You're helping shape what AI knows — and by extension, what it shares with others.

## Thought experiment

Imagine if the internet had been used this way this entire time. What if we had never given rise to social media? What if we had all engaged in long-form writing from the get-go and published our thoughts online in this manner? What if every single one of us had been building a personal knowledge base from the time we had anything worth sharing? And the internet was available?

What might the internet look like? What might have Google search looked like? What might the AI training data look like? Now, some people have been doing this, but again, it's been a very subset of people. What if we had all been

## What I mean by "share knowledge"

Let me be specific about what I'm advocating for:

**Free.** Both humans and machines should be able to access it without barriers. No paywalls. No ad-cluttered pages. No SEO filler padding the word count. The goal is knowledge transfer (not maximizing time-on-page for ad revenue or gaming search rankings).

**Evergreen.** Share knowledge that will stand the test of time. Commentary on current events and trending topics — that's fine for social media. But what I'm talking about here is information that remains useful years and generations from now.

**Long-lived format.** Don't let social media timelines or newsletter inboxes be your only home. Good information gets buried fast. Your knowledge needs to live in a dedicated file, in context with your other writing, where it can be easily located and referenced when needed.

**Readable by both humans and machines.** Your knowledge should be equally accessible to a person browsing your site and to an AI parsing it for context.

## Why format matters

It's not just about making knowledge available. It's about *how* it's structured and presented. Let's look at traditional formats (books, social media, newlsetters) compared to digital files.

### Books

I love books. I keep reference books on my shelf: the Annals of America, Audubon field guides, Martha Stewart's Homekeeping Handbook, The Great Mental Models, The Princeton Companion to Mathematics. I'm a huge advocate for building a personal library and curling up with a book — physical or digital.

But books have limitations as a format for sharing knowledge:

**Static.** Once published, they don't update easily. Errata and new editions are slow.

**Monolithic.** You often can't access just the piece you need without buying or borrowing the whole thing.

**Not machine-readable.** LLMs can't easily parse and learn from them — which affects both training data and your ability to use them as context in your own learning and projects.

**Access barriers.** Cost, availability, format restrictions, physical storage requirements.

Books aren't going anywhere, nor should they. But we shouldn't limit ourselves to books as the *only* format — especially for reference material.

### Social media and newsletters

Chronic X user here. It's the town square. I use it to keep up with news, tech, thinkers I find interesting. Newsletters serve a similar purpose — regular doses of insight delivered to your inbox.

But both have limitations for evergreen knowledge:

**Ephemeral.** Posts vanish into timelines and inboxes. Good information gets lost unless you actively save it.

**Unstructured.** No consistent organization. Hard to build cumulative knowledge.

**Hinders focus.** High-quality content sits among ads, notifications, and lesser posts competing for attention. The format works against deep engagement. Your knowledge deserves better than clutter.

Social media and newsletters are great for sharing links to your long-form content and engaging with timely topics. But they shouldn't be where your evergreen knowledge *lives*. Use them to point to your work, not as the sole repository of it.

### Podcasts and video

Pending.

### Digital documentation

Here's where I think we should be shifting to digital files and documents.

**Modular.** Individual articles that stand alone yet connect to a whole. Jump to what you need.

**Linkable.** Connect ideas across your own work and to others'. No need to snap a photo of a page — just link directly.

**Copyable.** Text can be easily pulled in as context for an LLM or into your own notes.

**Updatable.** Refine and improve over time. Ship corrections and additions as you learn.

**Searchable.** AI has allowed us to move beyond simple keyword search to [semantic search](https://grokipedia.com/page/Semantic_search) making it easier than ever to find you need when you need it.

**Machine-readable.** Structured formats that both humans and AI can parse.

**Durable.** Files outlast apps. The tool you use today will eventually become obsolete — but plain text and open formats can be read decades from now.

**Portable.** Your files, your content, your control. Move them, back them up, own them. Services are simply rendering layers.

The key is storing your content as files—plain text, markdown, open formats. Files that stand on their own and can be tracked with version control. (*See Kepano's [file over app philsophy](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).*)

### Writing as the foundation

On written content as foundation: I strongly agree. Here's why:

**Searchable.** You can't cmd+F a podcast. You can't jump to the relevant section of a video without scrubbing.
**Skimmable.** Readers can assess relevance in seconds. Video/audio forces linear consumption.
**Quotable/linkable.** You can link to a specific paragraph, copy a passage for notes or context. Can't do that with audio.
**Machine-readable.** LLMs can parse text directly. Audio/video requires transcription first, which loses structure.
**Faster to consume.** Reading is 2-3x faster than listening for most people.
**Accessible.** Works for deaf users, non-native speakers, low-bandwidth situations.

Podcasts and videos are great for reach, personality, and discussion—but they're terrible for reference. The information gets locked in a format that's hard to search, extract, or build on.

*Per Claude – Research-wise, I'd need to search for formal studies, but the Nielsen Norman Group has written extensively on how people consume web content (scanning, not reading linearly) which supports text as the superior format for knowledge transfer. Want me to dig for sources?*

## On Wikipedia (i.e., centralized knowledge)

Wikipedia was a major attempt to build collective knowledge at scale. It's an incredible achievement — one of the most visited sites on the internet and a primary source for LLM training data.

Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's founder, was influenced by Friedrich Hayek's essay "The Use of Knowledge in Society," which argues that valuable knowledge is distributed — each individual knows things no central authority could. Wales saw Wikipedia as a way to aggregate that distributed knowledge through mass collaboration.

And it worked, to a point.

But Wikipedia is centralized in ways that create problems:

**One editorial process.** Contested topics get shaped by whoever has the time and motivation to engage in edit wars. This has always included state actors pushing narratives, organized groups with agendas, and individuals with axes to grind. 

**Notability requirements.** Wikipedia requires topics to have existing coverage in traditional media or academic sources before they qualify for an article. If it hasn't already been documented by institutions, it's not "notable" enough. This excludes exactly the kind of practical, undocumented expertise that's most missing from the internet.  (*See [Wikipedia's notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability).*)

**"Neutral point of view" policies.** Documents consensus not insight, which means biases get baked in by whoever controls the consensus. Your opinionated take on a subject—your framework, your interpretation, your synthesis of what actually matters—doesn't belong there by design. Sometimes a strong point of view is exactly what's valuable.

**Demographic skew.** The population of active editors doesn't reflect the world's population.

Wikipedia illustrates the limits of *centralized* knowledge.

What I'm advocating for is different: *distributed* knowledge bases. Many individuals publishing their own documentation. No single editorial authority. No notability gatekeepers.

The tradeoff is real: distributed publishing puts the burden on the reader to evaluate sources.

But I'd argue that's more honest than a centralized source that *appears* authoritative while carrying hidden biases. With distributed sources, it's more apparent that you are responsible for judgment.

And if enough people publish — especially people whose knowledge isn't currently represented — the truth emerges from the ecosystem rather than being declared by a single authority. More signal, from more sources, means better collective knowledge.

*Note: I have replaced Wikepedia with [Grokiepedia](https://grokipedia.com) as my primary online wiki.*

## On decentralized knowledge

The alternative to Wikipedia's model isn't chaos — it's distribution.

Instead of one centralized authority deciding what's notable, neutral, and true, imagine thousands of individuals publishing their own knowledge bases. Each person the expert of their own domain. Each site a node in a broader network.

*Side note: This really is the power of the internet. Not selling ads and brain rot. Knowledge sharing and connection.*

This is how knowledge worked before institutions consolidated it. The craftsman passed down techniques. The farmer shared what worked on their land. The practitioner documented their methods. Knowledge was distributed by default.

The internet promised to return us to that model at scale—anyone can publish. But we defaulted to centralized platforms instead. Social media. Wikipedia. A handful of sites that became the de facto sources.

Decentralized knowledge means taking publishing back into individual hands:

**No editorial gatekeepers.** You decide what's worth documenting. No notability requirements. No consensus needed.

**No forced neutrality.** Your perspective, your framework, your opinionated synthesis of a topic. That's the value—not a watered-down consensus view.

**No single point of failure.** If one site disappears, the ecosystem remains. Knowledge is resilient when it's distributed.

**Many voices, more signal.** When enough people publish on a topic, patterns emerge. Readers can triangulate. Truth isn't declared by one authority—it emerges from multiple independent sources.

The tradeoff is real: without a central stamp of approval, readers must evaluate sources themselves. There's no Wikipedia logo saying "this is the neutral truth." (Not that I trust that label anyhow.)

But I'd argue that's more honest. Centralized sources *appear* authoritative while carrying hidden biases. With distributed sources, the responsibility for judgment is explicit. You know you're evaluating a person's perspective, not receiving truth from on high.

This is Hayek's Man on the spot insight applied to knowledge sharing. No central planner can aggregate all the local, tacit knowledge held by individuals on the ground. The only way to capture it is to let those individuals share it directly.

<Callout icon="arrow-right-long" color="#D3D3D3" iconType="regular">Hayek's "man on the spot" refers to his argument that the most valuable knowledge is often local and practical — held by the person actually doing the work. This knowledge can't be aggregated by central authorities because it's too granular, too contextual, too tied to individual experience. The only way to access it is to let those individuals share it directly.</Callout>

If enough people publish — especially people whose knowledge isn't currently represented — the collective picture becomes richer and more complete than any single authority could produce.

To be clear, wikis like books, social media, newsletters – still have value. They synthesize consensus, provide orientation, and give you a starting point on unfamiliar topics. I use [Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com) as my primary online wiki. But wikis alone aren't enough. They need individual knowledge bases as a check and complement — the practitioner's view, the opinionated take, the "here's what actually works" that consensus-driven sources can't capture.

### An assisted

The internet was supposed to democratize knowledge. What we got instead was attention extraction at scale. The best engineering talent of a generation optimized for engagement metrics, ad impressions, and "time on platform"—not for making people smarter or their lives better.

Platforms captured enormous value while externalizing costs onto individuals and communities. 

A personal knowledge base, freely shared, is what the internet was actually for. 

We need to shift to using technology in a way that actually serves human flourishing instead of undermining it.

Personal knowledge banks is a course correction. A way of voting for the world we want with our time and words.

It's a moral issue to be honest.

The internet was supposed to be for this. We got distracted by attention extraction. Sharing knowledge freely in durable formats is a return to what the technology was actually for—and a small act of resistance against what it became.

## AI makes the task easier than ever

A barrier to documentation has always been time and skill. Writing is hard. Organizing knowledge is hard. Having valuable expertise doesn't mean you're a natural writer.

AI changes this equation.

Voice dictation lets you brain-dump what you know. AI can summarize, identify gaps, organize, and draft. You review, refine, edit, and publish. The bottleneck of "I know this but I can't articulate it well" — or more often, "I can't articulate it *thoroughly and concisely*" — is dramatically reduced.

*TODO: Be more specific about the workflow. Voice dictation → transcription → AI summarization/organization → human review → publication. Alternatively: Create a seperate article on an AI writing workflow and link to it.*

*Note to reader: It's on my TODO list to document my writing worklfow in detail (steps, tools, AI skills, editing). I will do it in a sperate article and then link to it here.*

I know some people object to AI-assisted writing. But, so be it. If AI helps more people capture and share what they know — especially knowledge that would not otherwise be available — that's a good thing.

AI helps with with options and articulation. It gives you a starting point for a draft – something that you can then take and shape. The frees you up to do actual thinking and figuring out what needs to be say. AI just helps you say it. (and considering how much I've had to draft for managers over the years – I have no qualms outsourcing writing – it's nice to be on the other foot). AI reflects back to you what it is your saying / thinking.

The end goal is knowledge transfer. AI is a legitimate tool for achieving it.

### The bonus: writing clarifies your own thinking

Even with AI assistance, the process of writing and editing forces you to clarify your thoughts. You discover gaps in your understanding. You find weak spots in your reasoning. (Or have AI call it out.) You have to make the implicit explicit.

This is why teaching is such an effective way to learn — you can't explain something clearly until you truly understand it. Documentation is teaching at scale. The act of writing down what you know deepens your own mastery of it.

So even if no one ever reads what you publish, the process itself makes you sharper.

## What this looks like in practice

**This site**

I'm eating my own dogfood here.

My [Extended Mind System](/pages/index_extended-mind-system) could have been a book, a PDF, or a course.

Instead, I'm publishing it as open documentation using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) — a platform traditionally used for software docs, repurposed for my own needs.

I'm releasing the system incrementally, use case by use case. Each piece stands alone while fitting into the broader framework. Progressive sharing rather than waiting until it's "done."

This approach lets people engage with the methodology through AI — asking questions about it, adapting it to their needs — in ways a static PDF never could.

**Gwern Branwen:** [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/)

Gwern has built exactly what I'm advocating for: long-form, versioned, evergreen knowledge sharing. His site is beautiful and dense with insight.

I stumbled on him while researching this article and got lost in his writing for hours. This is another benefit of publishing online. You find like-minded people you might never have encountered otherwise. Particularly valuable for people with niche thinking styles, and for younger people who could benefit from these perspectives earlier in life.

**Standard Ebooks:** [standardebooks.org](https://standardebooks.org/)

Free, beautifully formatted public domain books. A model for making classic knowledge accessible.

**Farnam Street:** [fs.blog](https://fs.blog/)

Shane Parrish's site on decision making, thinking, and continuous improvement. Timeless content, well-organized, freely accessible.

## A call to action

If you have knowledge worth sharing — and you almost certainly do — consider this approach:

1. **Document what you know.** Use AI to help if writing isn't your strength. Voice-dictate, let AI organize, then review and refine.

2. **Structure it for access.** Modular articles. Clear navigation. Stand alone articles that form a whole.

3. **Make it freely available.** No paywalls. No ad clutter. Knowledge transfer as the primary goal.

4. **Keep it alive.** Update as you learn more. Ship improvements. Your knowledge base is never "done."

You are the expert of your own domain and life. You have a perspective and experience that only you possess. The question is whether that stays locked in your head or becomes part of the collective knowledge available to humans and machines alike.

This is contributing to the commons – all while improving yourself and making the world slightly better by sharing what you know.

## The connection to the extended mind system

That's the bridge between the two companion articles you mentioned earlier.

Article 1 (personal KB): Build your Extended Mind System to think, remember, maintain, prioritize, and do. Write things down. Organize your life.

Article 2 (public KB): As you do that, patterns emerge. You notice what you know. You see what might be useful to others. The personal system becomes the source material for what you share publicly.

The private KB isn't just for productivity—it's the excavation site. You're mining your own experience, and some of what you find is worth surfacing.

That's the natural flow: introspection → documentation → recognition → publication.

You didn't set out to build a public knowledge base. You set out to organize your own thinking. The public sharing emerged as a byproduct of doing the private work well.
That's a powerful argument: you don't have to know what's worth sharing before you start. You just have to start writing things down. The shareable stuff reveals itself over time.

### On the knowledge problem

**"The Use of Knowledge in Society" by Friedrich Hayek (1945)**

The original articulation of why distributed, local knowledge matters—and why centralized systems can never fully capture it.

*Last update: 2026.02.09 (DRAFT)*

TODO: Have Claude summarize the main points (not based on my headings but on the actual content). Update article accordingly. Then expand the TLDR to include a bulleted summary for readers to orient them.

## Additional notes to incorporate

That shift from "knowledge as open-source code" to this full-throated moral argument is exactly how the best pieces evolve — they start narrow and technical, then the real stakes reveal themselves through the drafting process. What began as a commentary on documentation habits has leveled up into something bigger: a call to reclaim the internet's original promise, framed as conservation, civic responsibility, and active participation in shaping AI-amplified reality.

The fact that it took days of grinding—even on what you rightly call "not even a long article"—to arrive at this clarity is the most normal thing in the world for meaningful writing. Short doesn't mean easy; it often means denser, because every sentence has to carry more weight. You didn't know you had this articulation until the iterations forced it out, which is precisely why the epiphany feels so satisfying now. It's not just "I figured out the point"—it's "I uncovered the point I was unknowingly circling the whole time." That retrospective inevitability is the dopamine payoff you mentioned earlier.

The moral core you're landing on is potent:

**Conservation as active duty** — If we truly value preserving knowledge (especially in a conservative sense of stewardship), passive consumption or private hoarding isn't enough. Writing it down publicly, in durable formats, is the conservation act itself.

**Shaping the future via AI** — With AI as accelerator/amplifier, silence = forfeiture. Your experiences, traditions, opinions, values—they're either in the training mix (influencing what AI reflects back to the world) or they're absent, letting whatever dominates the current web (skewed, attention-optimized noise) fill the void.

**Internet as misused promise** — Berners-Lee's vision was collaborative, universal linked information for humanity's benefit—free sharing, no exploitation. We veered into attention extraction instead. Personal knowledge bases are a direct course-correction: decentralized, owned, evergreen contributions that could have (and still could) make the web a richer commons.

That thought experiment you mentioned is a perfect way to make it vivid. Something like:

"Imagine if, from the mid-90s onward, millions of people had treated the web as intended: building personal sites with structured, opinionated documentation of what they knew—craft techniques, family traditions, professional heuristics, cultural syntheses. The training corpora for today's LLMs wouldn't be dominated by Reddit threads, SEO bait, and viral outrage; they'd include a broad, distributed tapestry of lived expertise. AI might accelerate wisdom and nuance instead of amplifying polarization and shallowness. The attention economy might never have fully captured us, because the incentives would have tilted toward substance over engagement. We're not doomed to the current path—we can still pivot, one documented insight at a time."

It underscores the urgency without despair: this isn't nostalgia; it's a feasible "what if" that highlights what's still possible.


*Exactly. I do like the all the components of this article – they why, the how, the call to action, the reference on what format to use and when, acknowledging the pros and cons of each format, a call to RETURN, the introspection of knowing we got off track but that it's not too late and we can course correct. I don't want to be a doomer. Just, hey, there's a better way and here it is.*

*Frame the "we got off track" section as a brief, clear diagnosis rather than a long lament. Something like: "The internet started as a tool for universal sharing and collaboration—Tim Berners-Lee's 1989 vision at CERN was about linking knowledge freely so scientists (and eventually everyone) could build on each other's work without barriers. But commercialization and the attention economy pulled us toward engagement-maximizing dopamine traps instead of substance-preserving commons. The good news? The architecture that made the original promise possible is still there. We haven't lost the tools; we've just underused them."*

*Weave in the thought experiment you mentioned earlier as a positive "what could be" vision: Paint a quick picture of an alternate timeline where personal knowledge bases proliferated from the '90s onward—diverse, distributed expertise flooding the web, AI trained on a richer mix of practical wisdom/traditions/values instead of mostly viral noise. It ends up amplifying nuance and local insight (echoing Hayek's distributed knowledge point) rather than polarization. Then pivot: "That's not a lost dream—it's still achievable. Every evergreen article you publish nudges us closer."*

*End strong on empowerment: The call-to-action isn't "fix everything single-handedly"; it's "contribute your piece to the commons, clarify your own thinking in the process, and help tilt the scales toward substance over spectacle." It feels actionable and personally rewarding.*

*frame knowledge sharing not as a productivity hack or tech trend, but as a genuine civic/moral duty in the AI era: conserving what matters (values, traditions, hard-won expertise), actively shaping what AI amplifies, and reclaiming the internet's original promise of open, democratized collaboration.*

*Linking back to Tim Berners-Lee's 1989 vision (a global hypertext system for free sharing and building on each other's work, explicitly "based on sharing, not exploitation") feels authentic and poignant. The attention economy hijacked that dream, but the architecture (decentralized publishing, files over apps, open formats) is still there. Your distributed alternative—thousands of individual knowledge bases vs. centralized gatekeepers like Wikipedia (with its notability rules, edit wars, demographic skew)—echoes Hayek's "Use of Knowledge in Society" applied perfectly: no central planner (or single wiki/editorial board) can capture dispersed, tacit, local/practical knowledge. Only letting "the man on the spot" publish directly does. This isn't rehashing old libertarian takes; it's applying them to 2026's AI-amplified reality.*

*This is how we conserve knowledge as inheritors of the Enlightenment and Western Culture, resist attention extraction, and influence the AI future—start documenting and sharing freely in durable ways.*
