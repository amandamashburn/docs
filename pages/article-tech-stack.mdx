TODO: For each piece of hardware and app, explain why I have it, how I use it, and share any general notes that may be worthwhile to the reader. 

As a kid, I always got very excited about getting my school supply list and shopping for everything at Walmart. This feels a bit like sharing the adult version of my school supply list.

For the record, I would have killed to have had Notion and reMarkable in college.

## Desk setup

I'm a huge proponent of investing in a desk setup. Afterall, it is where I think and work. 

- Standing desk with power strip

- Office chair

- Lighting

- Monitor

- Keyboard

- Mouse

- Organizers for pens and odds and ends

- Stands for computer and iPad

- Anker charging station

- Cable management to keep things tidy

- Stationary I have at the ready: pens, looseleaf paper, clipboard, rulers, binder clips, envelopes for leaf pages, index cards, post its, linen covered bulletin board

- I also have a writing desk in my office for reading and work away from the computer.

## Hardware

- MacBook Air

- iPad

- iPhone

- Headphones: wired, wireless in the ear, wireless over the ear

- Kindle

- reMarkable: Journaling, brainstorming, reading, editing (words read different on paper - trsut me).

- ModRetro: Becuase I still love simple single use devices and I'm a Tetris addict.

- Ember Mug

TODO: Explain why I stay within and the benefits of the Apple ecosystem from a software and hardware standpoint.
- Easy device setup
- iCloud integration
- copy and paste across devices
- find my iPhone
- iMessage and location share with friends and family
- what else?

## Apps and Tools

- Notion

- Obsidian

- VS Code

- GitHub

- Vercel: So much better than freaking out about runaway AWS bills. Plus the interface is much nicer.

- iCloud

- Apple Notes

- Safari Reading List

- Apple Preview for PDFs

- Apple calendar

- iMessage

- Signal

- Email: Hey.com

- Email: Proton

- Proton Suite: VPN, file share

- reMarkable storage (grandfathered in)

- X (yes – this has become an indespendable tool)

- What else? List everything I reach for on a regular basis.

## AI Tools

- Claude: General research and conversations. When GenAI was first gaining traction, I actually started heavily with Claude then went to ChatGPT. Now, I'm back with Claude. 

- Claude Code: Use the CLI for coding in VS Code. Still learning and developing my Claude Code workflow. From what I have seen it's the tool I want to focus on learning for the time being. It's wild that I can prompt entire applications. Using it to primarily build personal software, my personal website, and this docs repo.

- Grok: I do use this fairly heavily to under 𝕏 profiles and to get more context and information about posts. 

- Wispr Flow: I've taken to voice dictation pretty quickly.

- Notion AI: Great for modifying Notion pages directly although most of my conversations happen in the Claude web app.

Note: I have transitioned away from ChatGPT due to redundency with Grok and Claude, can access it through NotionAI. Plus, paying for all these AI tools starts to add up.

## Staying Connected

- Starlink

- Starlink mini

## Why I stay in the Apple ecosystem

- Switched in college pursuing my CS degree and never looked back.

- It just works.

- Because I have iCloud, use Safari, purchase apps in the store – I can pick up any device (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air, Mac Mini) and have access to all my files, passwords, apps, calendar, etc. 

- Great built in utilities such as timer and stop watch

- I like the OS is built on top of Unix and this translates into liking the command line far more than on a windows

- The one thing I will hand over to PCs is that they do run Excel better but I've graduated beyong Excel files to CSVs, having AI run data analytics with SQL and Python, and use LibreOffice as my traditional spreadsheet needs are pretty light these days. (Also, I never got used to Apple's Office Suite).

- I've always been a big fan of their recycling and trade in program.

- I lean on the copy / paste between devices quite a bit.

- It's not uncommon to pair my iPad with MacBook air or Mac Mini.
