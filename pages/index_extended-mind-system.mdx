## An Extended Mind System

This system documented in these pages is my personal approach to how I think, remember, maintain, prioritize, and do. It is a system that has been built upon the foundations listed below, adapted to my thinking style, and refined through years of daily use.
- The Organized Mind by Daniel Levitin
- Getting Things Done by David Allen
- The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll

## What You'll Find
What is shared here is not prescriptive. Rather, it's meant to serve as a starting point and inspiration for building your own system. The methodology is tool-agnostic, but I'll be sharing implementations for both Notion and Obsidian.
Each use case can stand alone but fits into the broader framework, so you can start small and expand as needed.

## Current Status – Building in Public

This site is actively being built with the initial release pending. Once the initial version is released – use cases will be added as they are documented.
