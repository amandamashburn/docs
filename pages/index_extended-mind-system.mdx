This is my personal approach to how I think, remember, maintain, prioritize, and do — a system I've built and adapted over years of daily use.

If you're a fan of any of the following, you'll likely be a fan of this system too (and you'll definitely see their influence):

## What you'll find

The methodology itself is tool-agnostic, but each use case includes practical implementations for Notion and Obsidian.

Nothing here is prescriptive. It's meant as a starting point — take what works, leave what doesn't, and adapt it to your own thinking style. Each use case stands alone but fits into the broader framework, so you can start small and expand as needed.

## Current status

Use cases are added as they are documented.
