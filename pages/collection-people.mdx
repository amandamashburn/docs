## What to expect

Your phone's contacts app stores names and numbers. It doesn't store how you met someone, what they mentioned about their family, or which city they live in now. The People collection is a personal Rolodex built for the full picture – contact information, relationship context, and whatever details help you actually know someone over time.

## What will be covered

**Why a contacts database beats a contacts app**. A standard contacts app is a lookup tool. A database is a relationship management system. The difference is in what you can do with it: filter by location, by how you know someone, by context. We'll cover what that looks like in practice.

**Dual-axis tagging**. Contacts are tagged along two dimensions simultaneously: relationship type (family, friend, colleague, acquaintance, neighbor, etc.) and context or origin (work, school, family friends, 𝕏, etc.). This isn't redundant – it answers two different questions at once. Who is in my social circle and where do I know them from.

**What lives in the page**. Each contact's page is where the real depth accumulates. Favorite meals, family details, shared history, links they've sent, notes from a recent conversation. These are the small details that slip from memory but matter when you want to show up for someone well. Mobile entry is key here – capturing details in the moment, on the go.

**The geocoded address field**. Addresses are stored as a place property, which means they're geocoded and could be displayed on a map. This enables a potential map view of where your contacts are located – useful for trip planning, or simply knowing who's nearby.

**Notion implementation**. Database setup, properties, views.

**Obsidian implementation**. How to replicate the collection using Bases, including property setup and view configuration.
