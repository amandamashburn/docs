## What to expect

Most people have opinions. Few have thought them through. The Opinion Bank is a structured space for doing exactly that – capturing positions you hold, writing out the reasoning behind them, and refining them over time. Each entry is an opinion or argument on a topic that matters to you, with room to develop it into something you could actually defend.

## What will be covered

**The three-way split: facts, opinions, and values**. The Opinion Bank exists alongside the Knowledge Bank (what you know) and Core Principles (what you believe). The distinction between these three is one of the most clarifying ideas in the system. Many people conflate facts, opinions, and values – treating opinions as facts, or values as self-evident truths. Separating them forces you to be honest about what you're actually claiming and why.

**What makes a good opinion**. An opinion worth holding is one you can articulate, support with reasoning, and test against counterarguments. We'll cover what that looks like in practice, including templates and AI prompts for working through a position rigorously. This includes thinking through what good and bad looks like for a given topic – a skill most people were never taught explicitly.

**Opinions as projects**. Every well-formed opinion requires real effort to develop. Treat each entry as a scoped project that takes time, research, and revision. The collection naturally forces prioritization: you can't hold strong opinions on everything, and you shouldn't pretend to.

**The seed bank for public writing**. Opinion Bank entries are the raw material for newsletter essays, articles, and any other public writing. The work of developing the opinion happens privately; publishing is just a downstream step.

**How opinions evolve**. Returning to an entry months later reveals how your thinking has changed. The last-edited timestamp makes this visible. We'll cover how to use the collection as a record of intellectual development over time.

**Notion implementation**. Database setup, properties, views, templates.

**Obsidian implementation**. How to replicate the collection using Bases, including property setup and view configuration.
