## What to expect

Everything in the Extended Mind System lives in a database. Before diving into any individual collection, it's worth taking the time to understand what databases actually are, why they're so useful for organizing information, and how to get the most out of them in Notion and Obsidian.

This is required reading before exploring any of the collections. The concepts here show up everywhere.

## What will be covered

**What a database is** – At its core, a database is just a structured collection of related items. Your reading list is a database. Your project list is a database. Once you start seeing information this way, it changes how you think about organizing everything.

**What metadata is** – Metadata is information *about* your information. The author of a book, the status of a project, the date you saved an article – these are all metadata. We'll cover what metadata fields are, how to choose them, and which standard fields show up across almost every use case in this system.

**Building views** – One of the most powerful features of both tools is the ability to look at the same database in completely different ways without changing the underlying data. We'll cover filtering, sorting, grouping, and calculations – including custom formulas – and how to build views that surface exactly what you need, when you need it.

**Pages within databases** – Each entry in a database is also a full page. That's where the real magic is. The database gives you structure and organization; the page gives you depth. A single entry can hold text, images, embedded videos, links, and more – all organized under the same metadata that makes it findable and sortable.

**Database templates** – Templates let you define a starting structure for every new entry. A new book always opens with the same metadata fields. A new project always starts with the same sections. This is one of the highest-leverage habits you can build – it eliminates friction and enforces consistency without any extra effort.

**Notion implementation** – How databases work natively in Notion, the different view types available, quirks to be aware of, and how linked databases differ from source databases.

**Obsidian implementation** – How [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) treats your Markdown notes as database records and their properties (stored as YAML frontmatter) as fields – giving you filterable, sortable, grouped views over your entire vault. We'll cover how Bases works, how it integrates with Obsidian's existing Properties system, and what the quirks are worth knowing about.
