## What to expect

Two tools dominate the personal knowledge management space right now: Notion and Obsidian. They're both excellent — and they're built on fundamentally different philosophies. Choosing between them is one of the first real decisions you'll make when building your extended mind system.

This article is a full side-by-side comparison. By the end, you'll understand what each tool does well, where each one falls short, and which one makes sense for where you are right now.

## What will be covered

**The core difference** — Notion is a collaborative, cloud-based workspace built around databases and structured content. Obsidian is a local-first, Markdown-based tool built around linked notes and files you own. They share some surface-level overlap, but the underlying model is completely different.

**Who Notion is for** — If you want something that works out of the box, has ample integrations with existing tools, and doesn't require much technical setup, Notion is likely your tool. Its database model is powerful and approachable, and the interface is polished enough that non-technical users get up and running quickly.

**Who Obsidian is for** — If you want full ownership of your data, prefer working in plain Markdown files, and don't mind a steeper learning curve in exchange for more flexibility and control, Obsidian rewards the investment. It's particularly well-suited to people who think in connections and want to build a true knowledge graph.

**AI integration** — Notion has built-in AI and just released Agents, making it a strong choice for users who want AI features without additional setup. Obsidian takes a different approach — it works exceptionally well with Claude and Claude Code plus has its own CLI, making it highly customizable for those who want tighter, more intentional AI integration. We'll look at what each approach actually looks like in practice.

**Privacy and sensitive information** — Because Obsidian is local-first and your data never lives on someone else's server by default, it's worth serious consideration for anyone working with confidential information or sensitive IP. If that matters to you, it changes the calculus considerably.

**Collaboration** — Notion wins here, and it isn't close. If you want to share a workspace with family members, a partner, or a small team, Notion is built for that. Obsidian is fundamentally a personal tool.

**Pricing** — Notion offers a free tier with meaningful limitations and paid plans starting at $12/month. Obsidian is free for personal use with optional paid add-ons (Sync, Publish). We'll break down what you actually get at each tier and whether the paid plans are worth it.

**How to decide** — A simple framework for choosing based on your comfort with technology, your collaboration needs, how much you care about data ownership, and how you naturally think and write.
