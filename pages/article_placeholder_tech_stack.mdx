TODO: For each piece of hardware and app, explain why I have it, how I use it, and share any general notes that may be worthwhile to the reader. 

As a kid, I always got very excited about getting my school supply list and shopping for everything at Walmart. This feels a bit like sharing the adult version of my school supply list.

For the record, I would have killed to have had Notion and reMarkable in college.

## Desk setup

I'm a huge proponent of investing in a desk setup. Afterall, it is where I think and work. 

- Standing desk with power strip

- Office chair

- Lighting

- Monitor

- Keyboard

- Mouse

- Organizers for pens and odds and ends

- Stands for computer and iPad

- Anker charging station

- Cable management to keep things tidy

- Stationary I have at the ready: pens, looseleaf paper, clipboard, rulers, binder clips, envelopes for leaf pages, index cards, post its, linen covered bulletin board

- I also have a writing desk in my office for reading and work away from the computer.

## Hardware

- MacBook Air

- iPad

- iPhone

- Headphones: wired, wireless in the ear, wireless over the ear

- Kindle

- reMarkable: Journaling, brainstorming, reading, editing (words read different on paper - trsut me).

- ModRetro: Becuase I still love simple single use devices and I'm a Tetris addict.

- Ember Mug

TODO: Explain why I stay within and the benefits of the Apple ecosystem from a software and hardware standpoint.
- Easy device setup
- iCloud integration
- copy and paste across devices
- find my iPhone
- iMessage and location share with friends and family
- what else?

## Apps and Tools

- Notion

- Obsidian

- VS Code

- GitHub

- Vercel: So much better than freaking out about runaway AWS bills. Plus the interface is much nicer.

- iCloud

- Apple Notes

- Safari Reading List

- Apple Preview for PDFs

- Apple calendar

- iMessage

- Signal

- Email: Hey.com

- Email: Proton

- Proton Suite: VPN, file share

- reMarkable storage (grandfathered in)

- X (yes – this has become an indespendable tool)

- What else? List everything I reach for on a regular basis.

## AI Tools

- Claude: General research and conversations. When GenAI was first gaining traction, I actually started heavily with Claude then went to ChatGPT. Now, I'm back with Claude. 

- Claude Code: Use the CLI for coding in VS Code. Still learning and developing my Claude Code workflow. From what I have seen it's the tool I want to focus on learning for the time being. It's wild that I can prompt entire applications. Using it to primarily build personal software, my personal website, and this docs repo.

- Grok: I do use this fairly heavily to under 𝕏 profiles and to get more context and information about posts. 

- Wispr Flow: I've taken to voice dictation pretty quickly.

- Notion AI: Great for modifying Notion pages directly although most of my conversations happen in the Claude web app.

Note: I have transitioned away from ChatGPT due to redundency with Grok and Claude, can access it through NotionAI. Plus, paying for all these AI tools starts to add up.

## Staying Connected

- Starlink

- Starlink mini
