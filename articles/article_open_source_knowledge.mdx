🚧 UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

**Core Thesis:** Why I'm choosing Mintlify over a traditional PDF or ebook to share my Extended Mind System.

## Intro
- The shift from PDF to open documentation
- What this enables that a static book cannot

## Technical Advantages: Treating Documentation as Code
- **Portable and controllable**: Markdown files, Git versioning, GitHub hosting
- **Living documentation**: Ship updates as features, keep content evergreen
- **Tool-agnostic approach**: System principles outlast any specific tool
- **Version control**: Track what changed and when, maintain detailed history

## Why Mintlify: The Platform That Checked All the Boxes
- **Built for humans and machines**: Designed specifically as a knowledge base for both — this was the deciding factor
- **Ideal layout**: Left sidebar navigation, article in center, table of contents on right
- **Developer-friendly**: GitHub integration, markdown-native, treats docs as code
- [Additional reasons you love the tool—can expand on these as you write]

## Building in Public: Ship as You Create
- **Atomic articles**: Individual pieces that stand alone yet connect to the whole
- **Progressive sharing**: Don't wait until it's "done"—share the roadmap as you work through it
- **Context preservation**: Each article maintains its relationship to the overall system
- **Iterative improvement**: Updates and evolutions are features that get shipped over time

## Accessibility: Human and Machine Readable
- **For humans**: Free access removes barriers to self-improvement
- **For LLMs**: Enables people to interact with the content through AI, personalizing it to their needs
- **Reaching those who can't book 1:1 time**: Democratizes access to the methodology

## The AI Training Data Problem
- Wikipedia and Reddit are highly biased sources dominating training datasets
- **Counter-measure**: Individuals documenting and sharing their knowledge publicly
- Contributing to a more balanced information ecosystem

## Better Than the Current Default (Social Media/Substack)
- Posts are fleeting — lost to timelines and inboxes
- Permanent home makes evergreen content easily referenceable
- Structure over streams

## The Open Source Philosophy
- "If you want a better world, you need better individuals"
- This system can facilitate introspection, self-governance, lifelong learning
- Information this valuable shouldn't be locked behind paywalls

## Conclusion: A Call to Action
- Too much knowledge is locked away—in books, behind paywalls, behind firewalls
- If we want humans and machines to reflect our knowledge, we need to share it
- Invitation: If you have knowledge to share, consider this approach
