# Best Practices

Use TODO in project names or tags to note placeholder pages. Batch process them when you have time or allow them to serve as an anti-library of thought.
TODO: Create a page on the concept of an anti-library.

Use a database template to generate new databases.

TODO: List out my preferred database defaults.

On databases: Begin wide, not narrow. Let categories emerge. You can always break a database apart and migrate pages.

Keep file systems flat.

In Obsidian – use file naming conventions.

For informational and reference pages - treat them as knowledge objects. Make them the smallest unit possible.

Write information once. Reference it everywyere. Use links and synced blocks (Notion) to do this.

Create a knowledge graph by linking notes. Link forward and back.

Treat your extended mind as an artifact for future you, future generations, and machines. They'll appreciate your notes.

I have very few hard and fast rules, but this is one – projects MUST begin with a verb and (theoretically) should reflect your desired end state. 

Reverse engineer projects into sub-projects until you get to a task you can do to move the needle forward. Complete a sub-project and it's associated tasks in full before moving onto the next sub-project of the primary project.

TODO: Dig through Apple notes, Notion, and Scrivener to put all my best practices in this doc. 
TODO: Start up a project in Claude and have him help me clean up and draft this article.
