## An Extended Mind System

THINK. REMEMBER. MAINTAIN. PRIORITIZE. DO.

This system is my personal approach to building an extended mind - a way to externalize thoughts, organize knowledge, and maintain focus in a world of constant information. If you're familiar with the following works, you'll recognize their influence throughout. I've taken what works from each and adapted it into something that suits my thinking style.
- The Organized Mind by Daniel Levitin
- Getting Things Done by David Allen
- The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll

## What You'll Find
This isn't a prescriptive system telling you exactly what to do. Rather, it's meant to serve as inspiration and a starting point for building your own. The methodology is tool-agnostic, but I'll be sharing implementations for Notion and Obsidian with suggestions for applied AI to help you build and maintain an extended mind system.
Each use case stands alone but fits into the broader framework, so you can start small and expand as needed.

## Current Status – Building in Public

This documentation site is actively being built with the initial release pending. Once the initial version is released – use cases will be added as they are documented. The system itself has been refined through years of daily use - now I'm writing it all down it so others can learn from it, adapt it, and build their own extended minds.
