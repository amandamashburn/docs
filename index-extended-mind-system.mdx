**The Extended Mind Thesis:**

In 1998, Andy Clark and David Chalmers published "The Extended Mind," which fundamentally challenged where we draw the boundary of cognition. Their core argument: cognition doesn't stop at the skull. When we use tools, notebooks, or technology that perform cognitive functions, those external resources become *part* of our cognitive system, not just aids to it.

**The Parity Principle:**

Their key insight was the "parity principle" - if an external process performs the same functional role as an internal cognitive process, and if it were internal we'd call it cognitive, then it counts as genuinely cognitive even when external.

**The Famous Thought Experiment - Otto and Inga:**

- **Inga** wants to go to MoMA. She recalls from memory that it's on 53rd Street and goes there.
- **Otto** has Alzheimer's and uses a notebook. He looks up MoMA's location in his notebook and goes there.

Clark and Chalmers argue: Otto's notebook *is* his memory, functionally equivalent to Inga's biological memory. It's not just helping him remember - it *is* remembering for him. The notebook is part of his cognitive system.

**Why this matters philosophically:**

Traditional philosophy assumed cognition = brain activity. Extended Mind says: cognition can include iPhones, notebooks, Excel spreadsheets, filing systems - anything that's:
1. Reliably available when needed
2. Automatically endorsed (you trust it without conscious verification)
3. Easily accessible
4. Information was consciously endorsed at some point in the past

**Active Externalism:**

Clark emphasizes "active externalism" - the environment doesn't just support cognition, it *drives* it. Your external systems don't just store information; they actively shape how you think, what connections you make, what ideas emerge.
